# NFL draft model

The National Football League Draft, is an annual event which serves as the league's most common source of player recruitment. Each team is given a position in the drafting order in reverse order relative to its record in the previous year, which means that the last place team is positioned first and the Super Bowl champion is last. From this position, the team can either select a player or trade its position to another team for other draft positions, a player or players, or any combination thereof. The round is complete when each team has either selected a player or traded its position in the draft. The first draft was held in 1936, and has been held every year since.

## The model

Using the stats for their last college year for over 300 prospects I have classified which ones will get drafted and which ones won't according to the drafts of 2020 and 2021.
I've used random forest classifiers in order to get the results
